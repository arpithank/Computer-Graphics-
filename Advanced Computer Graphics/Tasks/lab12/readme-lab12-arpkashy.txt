As seen in the lab, my code seems to be perfectly alright but the axis is not seen on the screen at all. 
I have set Fov to 121
Aspect ratio to myViewPortWidth/myViewPortHeight
Near to 0.3 
and Far to 1000
I have given the right values for the axis to be drawn as well. I have called the draw function in void draw in order to draw the axes.


I have also calculated dx and dy in touches moved and passed it into the translation matrix in the vertex shader is order to achieve camera translation.
