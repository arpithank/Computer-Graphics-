#Computer Graphics Project

Performed Vertex by vertex drawing of 2D lines; Point-point and point-line segment proximity detection and highlighting.
Also performed fixed point translation and rotation in 2D. Also drew multi-segment 2D splines.
Drew 2D and 3D models. Loaded a car model and performed transformations and camera operations.

Used Two-dimensional graphics methods, transformations, and interactive methods. 
Also used Three-dimensional graphics, transformations, viewing geometry, object modeling and interactive manipulation methods. 
Basic lighting and shading. 
Video and animation methods
